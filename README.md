# Roadmap to Master DevOps and Embedded Linux

This repository provides a comprehensive, structured learning path to achieve professional expertise in **DevOps** and **Embedded Linux** from scratch. These fields share common ground in Linux systems, automation, scripting, and system optimization, making them complementary for building robust, scalable, and efficient systems. This roadmap outlines detailed topics, learning mechanisms, and hands-on projects to guide you from beginner to professional.

## Overview

- **DevOps**: Focuses on automating infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and managing scalable systems, often on Linux environments. Key skills include Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and cloud platforms.
- **Embedded Linux**: Involves customizing and deploying Linux on resource-constrained devices (e.g., IoT, automotive). Requires knowledge of kernel customization, cross-compilation, bootloaders, and hardware interfacing.
- **Common Ground**: Linux internals, scripting (Bash, Python), system optimization, and automation. DevOps tools can streamline embedded Linux development, while embedded skills enhance low-level system understanding for DevOps.
